# X-Force Search
* X-Force Search was written out of my frustration from using X-Force Exchange Search, IBM Security Advisories Secintel, CVEDetails, and NIST for CVSS rating of platform versions.

* I opted for a different approach to not create yet another vulnerability search tool and avoid repeating the same shortcomings.

* X-Force Search is a tool written in Python and JavaScript, that searches platform vulnerabilities using MITRE as a trusted source for CVEs and X-Force Threat Intel as a vulnerability scoring system. That strives to be more efficient and accurate for IBM systems than his fellow predecessors.
